# Our_Action_Learning
our project is about discovering exoplanets and then recognizing the habitable ones. we use 3 different models: an ANN model(based on Nasa Kepler data),a CNN model(based on exoplanets/planets images), and a clustering model (based on confirmed exoplanet data) to find out the possibility of habitability.


Developed a user-friendly web App using streamlit and integrated our models for the users.  The web App Includes 

Sign  In /  Sign up : Utilized Postgres to securely store user login details. 

Model Selection :  The user will be able to select our models (ANN , CNN, Clustering ) and  upload the dataset in form of csv or images to get the predictions.

Latest Article : Provide users with the latest news about exoplanets from reputable sources and Stay informed with up-to-date discoveries and breakthroughs in the rapidly evolving field of exoplanetary science.
